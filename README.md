# Python Review 2025 — Regrounding, Rebuilding, Remembering

> *“To know the forest, sometimes you must kneel and study the roots.”*

Hi there — I’m Nessa, a software engineer who’s spent the past few years architecting systems, deploying ideas into production, and finding the poetry between logic and flow. From spinning up AI pipelines to fortifying security boundaries, I’ve loved the chaos and clarity that come with building in tech. But lately, I’ve felt a pull — not forward, but inward.

Now as of the spring of 2025, I made a decision: to return to the fundamentals.

Not because I forgot them, but because I want to *remember* them differently — through the eyes of who I am now, not just who I was when I first learned to code.

This repo is my journey through a Python MOOC — not out of necessity, but out of reverence.
Out of love for the craft.
Out of curiosity for what nuance I might’ve missed in my rise toward complexity.
And out of a deep belief that mastery isn’t linear — it spirals.

## Why This Now?

* **To relearn with context.** Experience transforms how we see basics. What once felt arbitrary now feels elegant.
* **To slow down.** In a world that glorifies speed and ship dates, this is a return to intention.
* **To fill the quiet gaps.** The unspoken corners of language, the small "a-ha" moments that get lost when we move too fast.
* **To teach better.** Revisiting the foundations sharpens my ability to explain them — to myself, to others, to whoever needs a hand up the ladder next.

## What You’ll Find Here

* Clean, human-readable notes
* Annotated code with reflections
* Practice exercises — some reimagined
* Occasional metaphors and musings from a wandering mind in a technical world

## The Loop of Learning

Being a “senior” or “established” in this field doesn’t exempt us from the fundamentals — it deepens our relationship with them.
So this is me, looping back. Not because I have to.
Because I *want* to.

Thanks for being here.
Whether you're a beginner just starting out or a fellow builder circling back to the roots — there’s room for all of us here.

With care,
**Nessa Kodo**
